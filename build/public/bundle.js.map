If\n\t *    this is the initial mount (with no existing view), renders to null.\n\t *\n\t * In addition, supplying a `renderLoading` that returns undefined has the same\n\t * effect as not supplying the callback. (Usually, an undefined return value is\n\t * an error in React).\n\t *\n\t * === Refs ===\n\t *\n\t * References to elements rendered by any of these callbacks can be obtained by\n\t * using the React `ref` prop.

(Usually, an undefined return value is\n * an error in React).\n *\n * === Refs ===\n *\n * References to elements rendered by any of these callbacks can be obtained by\n * using the React `ref` prop.
